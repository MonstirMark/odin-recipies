 <h1>Crazy Chicken Soup</h1>
 <p><img src="soup.jpg" height="310" width="310"></p>
 <p>Freshly prepared chicken in its own juices.</p>
 <p>Marinated in a southern spiced rub and herbs,</p>
 <p>with fresh carrots, onions, and celery</p>
 <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
   <li>2 lbs chicken thighs</li>
   <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
   <li>3 teaspoons thyme</li>
   <li>2 teaspoons rosemary</li>
   <li>4 teaspoons blak magic</li>
   <li>1 cup carrot</li>
   <li>1 cup celery</li>
   <li>2 cups yellow onion</li>
   <li>4 qts chicken stock</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
  <h3>Step 1</h3>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
   <h3>Step 2</h3>
    <li>Lay chicken breasts evenly onto a baking sheet. Sprinkle with 1 tablespoon taco seasoning mix.</li>
   <h3>Step 3</h3>
    <li>Bake chicken in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 30 to 35 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Allow to cool enough to handle, then shred or cut into strips.</li>
   <h3>Step 4</h3>
    <li>While chicken is cooking, warm oil in a stockpot over medium-high heat. Cook and stir onions and celery in hot oil until onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in chicken broth and water; bring to a boil. Add remaining 1 tablespoon taco seasoning mix, cumin, and black pepper. Reduce heat to medium and simmer until flavors blend, about 30 minutes.</li>
   <h3>Step 5</h3>
    <li>Add chicken, tomatoes, and cilantro; simmer for 5 minutes. Serve soup hot topped with cheese, tortilla chips, and avocado.</li>
  </ol>
